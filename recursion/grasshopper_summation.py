"""
Write a program that finds the summation of every number between 1 and num.

The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

---

This exercise will help familiarize with the concept of recursion,
which means we call our function inside the function itself
to solve our problem

It can be solved by other means that are not recursion, but that
is not yet the scope of the task
